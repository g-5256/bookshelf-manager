- View all books.

- Search for a book.

- Update a book's rating.

- Delete a book.

Bug taxonomy: 

- UI/UX issues

- Functional issues

- Data handling and storage issues

- Performance issues

- Integration issues

3. Test Scenarios

Add a new book:

- Successful addition of a book.

- Attempting to add a book with missing details.

- Attempting to add a book that already exists.

View all books:

- Viewing with no books in the collection.

- Viewing with multiple books in the collection.

Search for a book:

- Successful search.

4. Test Cases : 









5. Black-box and White-box Testing

Black-box testing: Test the application without knowledge of the internal workings. This would involve testing the features as mentioned above.

White-box testing: Test the internal code. For our Streamlit app, this would involve checking the function that determines if a number is prime or not, ensuring there are no logical or syntax errors.

6. Unit and Integration Test

Unit Test: Test the function that determines if a number is prime or not.Integration Test: Test the entire Streamlit application as a whole, ensuring all components (input, processing, output) work together seamlessly.





























7. Test Reports

Once all tests are executed, a detailed report will be compiled. 

This report will detail each test's pass/fail status, identified bugs, and comments on the application's overall quality. 

Any failed tests will provide insights into application areas that need improvement. The report will also categorize bugs based on severity and provide recommendations for application enhancements. The acceptance of the application will be judged based on the percentage of tests passed and the severity of any identified bugs.

Based on each test case's pass/fail, a report detailing which tests passed, which failed, and any bugs identified will be compiled.

The acceptance of the application would be based on the percentage of tests passed and the severity of any bugs found.
